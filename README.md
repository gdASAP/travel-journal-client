## Planning Story
First the wireframe was made to have an idea, of how the app would look. Following the wirefram the html code was made to match the wireframe
as best as possible. The functionality was made first, using curl was able to communicate with the corresponsing API. Proceeded to create the journal components that would be used during the creation and editing process. Tested out CRUD request to make sure the API requests were working. After all the functionality was
up and running, the styling of the site was then made.
